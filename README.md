# bitConversion
Converts float values to different bit representations and back (floating point arithmetic). It is useful as a supplementary module in a memory-strained program.

This program took an insane amount of time and effort to make. It was a great experience, and the fulfillment I felt while completing it is something I won't ever forget, but it probably cut three years off of my lifespan.

I have no plans to update this.
